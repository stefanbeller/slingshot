This should be a complete collection of the files required to modify/translate the graphical data for the game Slingshot.

All of these graphics are licensed under the GNU General Public License.

There are three file formats used here:
png - where no more editable format is available, the png image format is used.
xcf - these images are layered editable bitmaps, use the GIMP to edit them.
xar - these are vector graphics files, use Xara Xtreme for editing.

Note about the *.xar files:
Xara Xtreme is now open source (at least, the Linux version is, and it's available at:
http://www.xaraxtreme.org/
Use Xara for editing the *.xar files, to then use them in the game, you'll need to
export the image to a png.

Have fun, and above all, abide by the GNU GPL!
