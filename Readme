This is essentially the developers version of Slingshot 0.8.1p

http://www.slingshot-game.org

In the slingshot/ directory you'll find the game, as it's in python, nothing more is required.

In the data-source/ directory you'll find the graphics in the best formats possible for
editing - see the readme file in that directory.

Please let us know if you package/modify/rerelease Slingshot, you're not obliged to,
but we like to know what's going on.

Have fun, and above all, abide by the GNU GPL!

:-)
